Replace log banners with function (too wide to fit on neat listing now)

Annotate >| redirection (overrides noclobber flag)

Replace `uname -a | awk` with `uname -r` or `uname --kernel-release` (print kernel release)
Note: --kernel-release is not supported in BSD (on Apollo); use -r instead
[Done: Replaced `uname -a | awk ...` stuff with `uname -r`]

Is there a better way to detect if this is a cron job than by setting a
command line variable? Perhaps detecting if terminal is attached?

Note: local variable func_name looks like hack to simulate shell variable FUNCNAME[0]?
[Done: Replaced $func_name with $FUNCNAME (no need to address index)]

Fix date stamp errors in stats file
Note: stats file seem to always run in 'initial' mode, giving default values,
making it totally useless.
